A few days ago, [dotenvx](/blog/2024/06/24/dotenvx-next-generation-config-management.html) reached **the number one spot on Hacker News**.

It would go on to accumulate [350 upvotes](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40789353), [200 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40789353), and drive a lot of traffic. When this happens to your project someday, here's what you might expect.

## Web Traffic 🌐📈

Thst works out to **100 visitors per point**. That's exceptional, especially considering these are some of the brightest minds in the world visiting your project.

Next, let's discuss the click-through rate to GitHub and star rate 🌟.

## GitHub Traffic 🐙

> 17% click-through rate

The [repo](https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx) was linked from the [blog post](/blog/2024/06/24/dotenvx-next-generation-config-management.html) and visitors found their way to it - (3,500 at peak, and ~1,250 on the shoulders). Let's call it 6,000 visitors to GitHub.

That's a **17% click-through rate** (6,000 / 35,000). You might see this in your project – maybe worse, maybe better. We had no call to action. I think people just really wanted to see the code – brightest minds, remember :).

## Star Count 🌟

> 13% star rate

There was a rapid star increase of +800 stars in less than 48 hours.

That's a **13% star rate** (800 / 6,000). Thank you HN 🧡.

## Summary

To summarize, landing at the top of HN could get you:

* **100 visitors per point**
* **10-20% click-through rate**
