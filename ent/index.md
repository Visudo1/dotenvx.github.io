  <p class="text-xl text-center">
    <strong>The Purpose.</strong> Some organizations need more than encryption—they need formal assurance. The <strong>Enterprise Assurance License</strong> provides SOC 2–aligned documentation, a signed SLA, and dedicated support for your security and compliance teams.
  </p>

  <div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-1 gap-4">
    <p class="text-left">
      <strong>Signed SLA & Legal Assurance.</strong> Formal agreement that dotenvx meets SOC 2 security, confidentiality, and availability controls.
    </p>
    <p class="text-left">
      <strong>Compliance Packet.</strong> Includes encryption details, architectural overview, and mapped responses addressing SOC 2 CC6 (Access Controls), CC7 (System Operations & Monitoring), CC8 (Change Management), and C1 (Confidentiality).
    </p>
    <p class="text-left">
      <strong>Zero-Knowledge Design.</strong> Verified architecture ensuring no plaintext secrets are ever transmitted, stored, or logged.
    </p>
    <p class="text-left">
      <strong>Dedicated Security Contact.</strong> Direct access to our security team for vendor assessments, auditor inquiries, or due diligence reviews.
    </p>
    <p class="text-left">
      <strong>Compliance-Ready Builds.</strong> Special enterprise builds remove debugging and diagnostic mechanisms, ensuring secrets can never appear in logs or traces.
    </p>

  <p>
    These deliverables map directly to SOC 2 controls under 
    <strong>Security (CC6, CC7)</strong>, 
    <strong>Confidentiality (C1)</strong>, and 
    <strong>System Operations (CC7)</strong>. 
    They provide clear, auditor-ready evidence that your organization protects .env files with enterprise rigor.
